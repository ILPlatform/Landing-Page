The rest of the module introduces CSS as well as basic knowledge about colours, fonts and images, which are widely used also in fields other than web programming.",
          "Then we continue with the introduction of the main tags in HTML, while the children continue to develop and improve the project from the previous module. In this way, we have the opportunity to deepen the CSS styles, as well as to demonstrate the good practices of creating a project that requires the organization of more than one folder or file.",
          "Towards the end of the module, the children complete the project we have been working on since the beginning. At this advanced stage we have the ability to show more difficult concepts such as document segmentation, pseudo-selectors and metadata. At the end, the project we have been working on is finished and the children have the opportunity to demonstrate what they have learned by modifying and styling it as they wish."
